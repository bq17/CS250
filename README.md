CS250 Sprint Review and Retrospective


   1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
      The best way to interpret user needs is to listen to the customer thoroughly and to ask questions based on the potential user needs that will be addressed by the development team later on in development. User Stories help clarify what these user needs are and help explain these needs to the development team so that everyone is on the same page throughout development.  
    
    
   2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
      You want to approach developing a program based on the user needs as well with understanding the resources you have in order to develop said program. I hope to work with some kanban practices regarding my future development work. Kanban almost looks as if it makes the whole process of development fun with utilizing a kanban board and making it a friendly competition amongst other developers trying to outdo one another while resolving user stories! 
   
   3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
      Being a good team member in software development regarding an agile approach of development requires someone to have strong communication skills, cross functionality is a huge plus within the development team and I would say the biggest attribute someone can offer is having a mindset focused on abdaptability and knowing there will be constant changes made throughout a project.
